# DeFi Credit Score

DeFi Credit Score is a web application that calculates and visualizes credit scores for Solana wallet addresses based on their DeFi activities on Jupiter and Kamino protocols.

## Features

- Fetches wallet data from Jupiter and Kamino protocols
- Calculates a credit score based on lending, liquidity, leverage, and swap activities
- Visualizes the credit score components using charts
- Provides a user-friendly interface for querying wallet addresses

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- A Solana RPC URL (default is https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
